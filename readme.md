# Cell-specific associations between DNAm and AD

Analysis plan can be found in [analysis-plan.docx](docs/analysis-plan.docx). 

Briefly, this project will include both conventional and cell-specific EWAS of AD in ARIES participants and potentially other cohorts. 

Analyses will be split into different folders, each with their own scripts and workflows. These will be detailed within readmes within those folders. 

## Analyses

* [data-extraction-and-qc](data-extraction-and-qc)
	+ Define AD in ARIES participants and QC pheno + DNAm data

* [ewas](ewas)
	+ []() : Generate SVs 
	+ []() : Run the EWAS using ewaff
	+ []() : Run the EWAS using cell-dmc 
	+ []() : Run the EWAS using TCA
	+ []() : Extract all sites that are associated with AD in a cell-type with one method and replicate in the other method
	+ []() : Run omicWAS with all the replicated sites
	+ []() : Analyse the results (Manhattans, etc.) + output nice tables 
	+ []() : Put results into a report
