# Cell-specific associations between DNAm and AD

Analysis plan can be found in [analysis-plan.docx](docs/analysis-plan.docx). 

Briefly, this project will include both conventional and cell-specific EWAS of AD in ARIES participants and potentially other cohorts. 

Analyses will be split into different folders, each with their own scripts and workflows. These will be detailed within readmes within those folders. 

## Analyses

* [data-extraction-and-qc](data-extraction-and-qc)
	+ Define AD in ARIES participants and QC pheno + DNAm data

* [ewas](ewas)
	+ Run conventional and cell-specific EWAS of AD
